## How to cite 
If you are using PROSPECT for a publication, please cite the PROSPECT release paper: *to appear on arXiv soon.* In addition, please cite the codes that PROSPECT uses in your work. This could be:
* An MCMC sampler, either [MontePython](https://github.com/brinckmann/montepython_public) or [cobaya](https://github.com/CobayaSampler/cobaya)
* Theory codes, such as [CLASS](https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public) or [CAMB](https://github.com/cmbant/CAMB)
* Data measurements and likelihoods that you use, for example the Planck 2018 data release [arXiv:1807.06209](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06209).
